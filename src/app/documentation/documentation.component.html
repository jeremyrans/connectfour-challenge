    <h2>Objective</h2>
    <p>
      The objective of this game is to write the best Connect4 Javascript AI you can. You will do this by implementing a single
      getCode() function, which takes in the state of the game and returns an integer representing the column (0 indexed)
      you wish to drop your piece in. The game will repeatedly call your algorithm with the new state of the game until one
      of the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>a winner is determined</li>
      <li>an invalid move is attempted</li>
      <li>a stalemate is reached</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>State</h2>
    <p>
      The first argument passed to your function is a 2d array representing the state of the board. More specifically, state is
      an array of rows and each row is an array of the columns in that row. The possible state of each cell is the integer
      0, 1 or 2.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>0 is an empty cell</li>
      <li>1 is your piece</li>
      <li>2 is your opponent's piece</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Here is an example state:</p>
    <pre style="border: 1px solid #666; background-color: #EEE; padding: 10px;">
      [
        [0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
        [0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
        [0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
        [0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
        [0,1,0,0,0,0,0],
        [1,2,2,1,0,0,0],
      ]</pre>

    <h2>isStartingPlayer</h2>
    <p>
      The second argument passed to your function is a boolean representing whether or not you are the starting player in the game.
      True indicates that you have taken your turn first, while false indicates your turn comes second.
    </p>

    <h2>Syntax</h2>
    <p>
      Your code
      <strong>must</strong> be in the following syntax in order to work:
    </p>
    <pre style="border: 1px solid #666; background-color: #EEE; padding: 10px;">
function getMove(state, isStartingPlayer) {{'{'}}
  return 0;  // index of the column to drop a piece in
{{'}'}}</pre>
    <p>
      Keep all code in a
      <strong>single function</strong> (inner functions are allowed).
    </p>
    <p>If your code returns an invalid move (like a column that's full, or one outside the board) it will end the game in your
      opponent's favour.</p>
    <p>Logging is available directly to your browser's console through
      <code>console.log(message)</code>. You can also use
      <code>console.error(message)</code>,
      <code>console.warn(message)</code>, and
      <code>console.debug(message)</code>.</p>
    <p>All built-in game state variables are backed up prior, and restored after, your function runs. This prevents tampering.</p>

    <h2>API</h2>
    <p>
      In addition to receiving the state of the board as an argument to your function, you have access to some helper functions
      that you can use to build your AI.
